## ✍️ Writer’s Note – REST Countries API

This sample documentation was created to demonstrate how I would approach documenting a public REST API. I selected the REST Countries API because it offers clean, well-structured JSON responses and practical use cases.

The documentation includes endpoint summaries, sample requests and responses, status codes, and developer-focused tips to simulate a real-world onboarding experience.
