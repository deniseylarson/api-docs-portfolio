# üåç REST Countries API Documentation

## Overview
This sample documentation demonstrates how I would approach documenting a public REST API for developers. I selected the REST Countries API because it provides clean, structured JSON responses and supports practical scenarios involving international data.

The REST Countries API allows users to retrieve country-specific details such as population, currencies, languages, regions, and borders. In a real-world context, this kind of API could be used in dashboards, data visualization tools, or apps requiring geographic insights. This documentation is designed to help developers understand available endpoints, make and test requests, interpret responses, and troubleshoot issues.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If a request returns `404`, double-check your spelling or use the `/all` endpoint to confirm the country exists.
- API may rate-limit requests if hit too frequently. Consider caching results locally.
- JSON keys may change slightly between versions; validate response structure before parsing.
